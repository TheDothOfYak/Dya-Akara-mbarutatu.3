   TORCAIN'S RUN — Rokarvac I: The Ruins of Aakalay
   Drawn from the Rokarvac: Noka has been carried off to a new
   mountain again and left a riddle. Its first step leads Tanoc —
   Torcain, now that he is Stamijan — and his friend Phorus, a
   Kalo'Eik and a Nur, to the dead city of Aakalay. There are
   stygian pieces everywhere; most of them are memory cores.
